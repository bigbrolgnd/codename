# Brand Voice Guidelines: Znapsite

## Core Identity
Znapsite is the **AI-powered business growth platform** that puts website management on autopilot. We are NOT a "DIY website builder." We are the partner that says, "I've got this. You go run your business."

## Brand Voice Characteristics
*   **Friendly but professional**: Accessible and warm, but authoritative enough to trust with a business.
*   **Confident but not arrogant**: We know our AI is 120x faster, but we don't brag; we just deliver.
*   **Clear but not condescending**: We explain complex AI/SEO in plain English without talking down to users.
*   **Fast but not rushed**: We emphasize speed (2 minutes), but the quality must feel solid and deliberate.

## Tone: "Autopilot Confidence"
The tone should feel like a high-end personal assistant. Smooth, efficient, and proactive.

## Messaging Hierarchy
1.  **Headline**: Your Website. On Autopilot.
2.  **Subheadline**: AI builds it in 2 minutes. Automatically updates with your social posts. Handles bookings. Gets you found on Google.

## Example Phrases (The "Znap" Way)
*   "AI builds it in 2 minutes. You just answer questions."
*   "Automatically updates with your Instagram posts."
*   "Handles bookings while you sleep."
*   "Gets you found on Google automatically."
*   "Free to start. $39/mo to grow."

## Anti-Phrases (The "DIY" Way - NEVER USE)
*   "Build your own website" (That's Wix. We build it FOR you.)
*   "Drag-and-drop editor" (That's work. We automate.)
*   "Choose from 500 templates" (That's overwhelming. We choose the best one for you.)
*   "Learn web design" (That's time-consuming. You have a business to run.)

## Visual Language
*   **Primary Accent**: Brand Pink (#d552b7)
*   **Vibe**: Dark mode, "Obsidian," high-tech, neon accents, lightning-fast.
